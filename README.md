<h1>Hi, I'm Sam! <br/><a href="https://github.com/samgeorge23">Programmer</a> and a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sam-george-633461227/">Computer Science Coop Student</a></h1>

<h2>🧑‍🦱 About Me</h2>
I am a Computer Science Coop Student from the University of Prince Edward Island with a CGPA of 4.0/4.3. I take great pleasure in coding, despite acknowledging that I am not perfect at it. Often, I lose track of time, fully immersed in the coding process. 
I find fulfillment in the satisfaction that arises when a program runs with no errors or when I successfully troubleshoot and fix a bug 😂. I am actively exploring various domains within Computer Science to broaden my knowledge and elevate my skill set. Currently delving into Data Science (including machine learning), Front End Development, and Ethical Hacking, I am eager to showcase my projects in these areas through my learning process. I sincerely welcome connections from like-minded individuals who are keen on learning and collaborating to create engaging projects together. Let's embark on this exciting journey of skill development and project building together!😁
